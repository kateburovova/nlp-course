To set virtual environment you should stay on root folder and run next command: `python3.6 -m venv venv`.  
Then you have to active virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`.  
After activation install packages from `requirements.txt`. To do it run `sh requirements_installation.sh`.  
To work comfortably with jupyter notebooks you should install kernel for your environment:
```bash
pip install ipykernel
ipython kernel install --user --name=nlp-course
```
